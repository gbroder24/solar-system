## The Solar System app is a personalized application for my domestic solar panel installation. Designed to log my housholds daily, monthly, yearly energy usage and view electrical utility bill savings based on my current rate. Programmed in the app is the display functionality where I can view what my daily, monthly energy use is, how much money I am saving per month. There is also a display to monitor how much you are paying back on the installed system.
